# Project Progress Log: E-Mail Automation Service (EAS)

This file tracks the high-level progress, key decisions, and phase completions for the EAS project.

## Phase 0: Documentation Gathering & Initial Setup

*   [X] Review existing documentation in `AI-Docs/` (Skipped: Directory did not exist)
*   [X] Retrieve initial documentation for key technologies using Context7 MCP
*   [X] Store initial documentation in `AI-Docs/`
*   [X] Review gathered documentation and identify gaps for Phase 1
*   [X] Retrieve and store supplementary documentation for identified gaps (Celery, Docker Compose, ORM Encryption, django-allauth, Structured Logging)
*   [X] Initialize Git repository (Already initialized)
*   [X] Create `PROGRESS.MD` file
*   [X] Set up basic project directory structure

## Phase 1: Foundation & Authentication

*   **Goal:** Set up project structure, Docker, DB, basic API, and Google OAuth.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [X] Initialize Django backend, set up `docker-compose.yml` (backend, PostgreSQL, Redis).
        *   *Note: Docker services (`db`, `redis`, `backend`) confirmed running via `docker-compose up`.*
    *   [X] **Frontend Project Setup and Dockerization:**
        *   Initialized React+TS+Vite frontend.
        *   Created frontend `Dockerfile`.
        *   Integrated frontend service into `docker-compose.yml`.
        *   Verified services build and run with `docker-compose up --build`.
    *   [X] Define PostgreSQL schemas using Django ORM: `Users` (incl. Google ID, OAuth tokens), `TaskConfigs`, `Schedules`, `Credentials` (for email providers, encrypted).
    *   [X] Implement initial migrations.
        *   *Note: Django superuser also created.*
    *   [X] **Backend Google OAuth 2.0 Configuration:**
        *   Configured `django-allauth` in `settings.py` for Google provider (scopes, auth params, PKCE).
        *   Included `allauth.urls` in `urls.py`.
        *   Applied necessary database migrations.
        *   Resolved `allauth` settings warning `(account.W001)`.
    *   [X] **Backend Token-Based Google OAuth Setup (using `dj_rest_auth` and `djangorestframework-simplejwt`):**
            *   Installed and configured `dj_rest_auth` and `djangorestframework-simplejwt`.
            *   Updated `settings.py` for JWT and `dj_rest_auth` settings.
            *   Updated `urls.py` for `dj_rest_auth` endpoints.
            *   Created a custom Google login view.
            *   Applied successful database migrations.
    *   [X] **Implement Google OAuth 2.0 Authentication (Full Flow):**
        *   [X] Frontend Google OAuth Implementation (Token-Based) for user registration/login.
    *   [X] Implement secure storage/retrieval for external API keys and OAuth refresh tokens (using encryption or secrets manager).
    *   [X] Set up basic Celery configuration and a simple test task.
    *   [X] Set up basic structured logging.
    *   [X] **Phase 1 Inspection & Verification:** Comprehensive static code/configuration review and runtime verification completed. All checks passed, confirming a robust foundation for Phase 2.

## Phase 2: Core Task Config & Scheduling Logic

*   [X] Backend - API Endpoints for TaskConfigs: Implemented DRF serializers, viewsets, and URL routing for CRUD operations on the TaskConfig model.
*   [X] Backend - API Endpoints for Schedules: Implemented DRF serializers (with validation and user-specific TaskConfig filtering), viewsets, and URL routing for CRUD operations on the Schedule model. Updated Schedule model with frequency choices and applied migrations.
*   [X] Frontend - Basic UI for TaskConfigs: Implemented React components, API service integration, and routing for CRUD operations on TaskConfigs.
*   [X] Frontend - Basic UI for Schedules: Implemented React components, API service integration, and routing for CRUD operations on Schedules, including linking to TaskConfigs.
