# TypeScript & React Integration Summary

*   **Component Definition:** TypeScript allows defining React components using both classes (`class MyComponent extends React.Component<Props, State>`) and functions (`function MySFC(props: Props) { ... }`).
*   **Props Typing:** Interfaces (`interface MyProps { ... }`) are heavily used to define the expected shape and types of props passed to components, ensuring type safety.
*   **Generics:** Generic components (`<T>`) and generic props (`Props<T>`) are supported, allowing for flexible and reusable components while maintaining type safety (e.g., `class GenericComponent<Props = {}, Values = object> extends React.Component<Props & BaseProps<Values>, {}>`).
*   **JSX Support:** TypeScript supports JSX syntax (`<MyComponent prop={value} />`). It requires React to be in scope (e.g., `import * as React from "react";`) and provides type checking for component names and attributes based on their definitions. The `JSX` global namespace can be used for advanced type definitions related to elements and attributes.
*   **Imports:** Standard ES module imports are used to bring in React and related libraries (`import React from "react";`, `import { useState } from "react";`).
*   **Common Patterns:** Snippets show common React patterns like default props (`static defaultProps = { ... }`), prop validation (though often relying on TypeScript's static checking), and Higher-Order Components (HOCs) implemented with generics.
